          <h2>Artist: Mac Miller</h2>
          <p>
            Malcolm was an American rapper and record producer. Miller began his
            career in Pittsburgh's hip hop scene in 2007. My favorite song from
            him is "Once A Day" from his album Circles, but still love his
            others songs as much as this one. Mac would unfortunatally pass away
            in 2018. This is a quote that I remembered from Malcolm "No matter
            where life takes me, find me with a smile."
